# ROS 2 Installation Guide
This document provides instructions for installing ROS 2 Humble Hawksbill on Ubuntu 22.04.

We chose ROS 2 Humble because it seemed the best option for us as a group, this means we are locked into using Ubuntu 22.04 as our Raspberry Pi OS as well, since Humble is only supported on Ubuntu 22.04. It is important to note that **it is not possible to install ROS 2 Humble on any other version of Ubuntu or any other OS**.


Just follow the official ROS 2 Humble installation guide for Ubuntu provided below:
